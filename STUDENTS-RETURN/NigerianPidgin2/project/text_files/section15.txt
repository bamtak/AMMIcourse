Maybe Jesus don know the result wey go come as e preach to the woman from Samaria. ## .
Many people from Sychar get faith for Jesus because of wetin the woman tell dem. E tell dem sey: ## .
“E tell me all the this wey I don do.” (John 4:39) So, when the people from Sychar reach the well, ## .
dem sey make Jesus stay with dem and tell dem more. Jesus gree, and e stay Samaria for two days. ## .

“No be just because of wetin you talk make us believe, now we don hear am by ourself, ## .
and we know sey na this man really be the person wey go save this world.” (John 4:42) ## .
The truth be sey the woman from Samaria don teach us better example of how to preach about the Christ, ## .
and to make wetin we talk sweet the people wey dey listen, so that dem go like to hear more. ## .

Jesus and im disciples don spend about eight months for Judea, dey teach and baptize people. ## .
As dem comot from here, na their town for Galilee dem dey go. Wetin go happen to dem for there? ## .
THE SAMARIA PEOPLE, WHO DEM BE? ## .

Dem start to marry Israel people wey still dey the land. ## .
As time dey go, dem come dey combine wetin dey God Law and juju worship; ## .

For Jesus time, Samaria people dey follow wetin dey the book of Moses, ## .
but dem no dey worship God for the temple wey dey Jerusalem. ## .
For many years, na the temple wey dem build for Mount Gerizim dem dey go do their worship. ## .
The place no far from Sychar, and dem still dey worship for that mountain ## .

Where for Galilee Jesus start this big preaching work? ## .
E clear sey na for Cana, where e turn water to wine for one marriage. ## .
As e come this second time, e hear sey one small boy dey sick and e go soon die. ## .
The boy papa dey work for King Herod Antipas wey later kill John the Baptist. ## .
As the boy papa hear sey Jesus don come Cana, e come travel from Capernaum where e dey live, ## .
