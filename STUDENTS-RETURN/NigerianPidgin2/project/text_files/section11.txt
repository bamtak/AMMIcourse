Wetin Mary dey tell Jesus be sey make e do something about this wine matter. ## .
But Jesus tell Mary sey: “Woman, how that one take concern me and you. ## .
” (John 2:4) Since Jehovah don choose Jesus as King, na im suppose dey direct everything wey Jesus go do, ## .
no be im family or friends. Mary na woman wey get sense, ## .
so e leave the matter for Jesus hand. E just tell the people wey dey serve sey: ## .
“Make una do anything wey e tell una.”—John 2:5.## .
Six pot wey dem dey fetch water put dey ground. ## .

“Make una fetch water put inside all the pot. ## .
” After, e tell dem sey: “Now, take small from inside the pot, ## .

The person wey dey direct the party like this wine well well. E no know sey na miracle dem take do am. ## .
E come call the man wey dey marry, e tell am sey: ## .
“Na the wine wey better pass people dey first bring come out. ## .
Na when everybody don drink well well, dem go come bring the wine wey no too fine. ## .
But you, na now you just dey bring the wine wey better pass come out.”—John 2:10. ## .
This na the first miracle wey Jesus do. When im disciples see this miracle, ## .
their faith for Jesus come strong more more. ## .
After, Jesus with im mama and im brothers come travel go Capernaum, ## .
wey dey the northwest side for the Sea of Galilee. ## .
Jesus Show Im Love for True Worship ## .
After the wedding for Cana, Jesus go Capernaum. ## .
Im mama and im brothers; James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas go with am. ## .
But why Jesus go Capernaum? Na because of the kind city wey Capernaum be. ## .
Because of where Capernaum dey, e dey easy for people to reach am, ## .
and e big pass Nazareth or Cana. No be only that one. ## .
Many of this people wey Jesus newly choose as im disciple come from Capernaum or dey live near there. ## .
So, e go dey easy for Jesus to train dem for their area. ## .
For Capernaum, Jesus do miracle. So plenty people for the area ## .
and other city wey near Capernaum hear wetin Jesus do for there.  ## .
Jesus disciples na Jew people wey dey use all their mind serve God. ## .
So, for this year wey be 30 C.E., dem go soon go Jerusalem for the Passover. ## .
As dem dey inside the temple for Jerusalem, ## .
wetin dem see about Jesus surprise dem. Dem never see Jesus like this before. ## .
For the law wey Jehovah give Israel people, e sey make dem dey do sacrifice for temple. ## .
And people wey come the temple go need food. ## .
And for the law, the people fit carry money come so that dem fit use am buy things like cattle, ## .
sheep, goat and other things wey dem go need for Jerusalem. ## .
(Deuteronomy 14:24-26) This one make some people come dey sell animals or birds for one big area for inside the temple. ## .
And some of dem dey cheat the people wey come buy things because the price wey dem dey sell the things too much. ## .
As Jesus see am, e vex. E trowey the coins of people wey dey change money,## .
e trowey their table and pursue the men comot. ## .
Jesus tell dem sey: “Make una carry all this things comot from here! ## .
No turn my Father house to market!”—John 2:16. ## .
