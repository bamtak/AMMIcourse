Mary stay with Elizabeth reach three months, and e go don help Elizabeth well well because e go soon born. ## .
E really make sense sey this two women wey holy spirit help get belle dey together, especially for this special time for their life! ## .
Remember, even before Mary born Jesus, dem show Jesus respect. When Mary reach Zechariah house, ## .
Elizabeth call Jesus “my Lord,” and the pikin wey dey Elizabeth belle “happy, come jump.” As we go see later, ## .
this one different from how other people treat Mary and the pikin wey dey im belle. ## .
Elizabeth go soon born. For three months now, Mary wey be im family member don dey with am. ## .
Now, time don reach make e go back. E go pass Judea area wey hill dey, before e reach im house for Nazareth. ## .
The journey far well well. Na six months remain for Mary self to born im own pikin. ## .
E no tey wey Mary go house before Elizabeth born. Everybody happy as nothing do Elizabeth and the pikin wey e born. ## .
Mama and pikin dey strong! Im neighbors and family people happy well well when Elizabeth show dem the pikin. ## .
For the Law wey God give Israel people, E tell dem sey when person born boy, e go circumcise am and give am name after eight days. ## .
(Leviticus 12:2, 3) Some people feel sey e go better for dem to give the boy im papa name wey be Zechariah. ## .
But Elizabeth no gree, e sey: “No! im name go be John.” (Luke 1:60) Remember, angel Gabriel don first talk sey make dem name am John. ## .
Im neighbors and family people no gree, na im make dem talk sey: “Nobody for your family dey answer that name.” ## .
(Luke 1:61) Dem use hand ask Zechariah which name dem go give the boy. ##.
Zechariah come sey make dem bring something make e write the name put. E write sey: “Na John be im name.”—Luke 1:63. ## .
As e write am finish, big miracle come happen, Zechariah start to talk again. ## .
Remember, when the angel tell am sey Elizabeth go born pikin, e no believe am. Na since that time e stop to talk. ## .
So as Zechariah start to talk again, im neighbors come dey wonder sey: ## .
“Which kind person this pikin go be?” (Luke 1:66) Wetin happen when dem dey name the pikin, show sey God dey with am. ## .
As holy spirit enter Zechariah body, e come start to talk sey: “Praise Jehovah wey be Israel God, ## .
because e don turn im face to im people and e don save dem. From the house of im servant  David, ## .
e don bring person wey get power well well wey go save us. ## .
” When e sey “person wey get power well well wey go save us,” e dey talk about the pikin wey Mary go soon born wey be Jesus. ## .
Zechariah still talk sey God go use am “save us from our enemy hand, we go get the strong mind to serve am well without fear. ## .
And we go hold am tight and dey clean for im eye everyday.”—Luke 1:74, 75. ##.
Zechariah still talk about im pikin sey: “But as for you this pikin, dem go call you prophet of the Most High, ## .
because you go dey Jehovah front to prepare im road, to teach im people sey e go save dem when e don forgive their sin, ##.
because our God get soft mind. Because of this soft mind, morning light go visit us from heaven, ## .
to give light to people wey sitdown inside darkness and shadow of death. And to make our leg waka for where peace dey. ##.
” (Luke 1:76-79) Wetin Zechariah talk no sweet you for mind? ##.
Now Mary don reach house. Everybody know sey e never marry. ##.
So wetin go happen to am when people see sey e get belle? ##.
Mary belle don reach four months now. Remember sey na when Mary newly get the belle e go visit Elizabeth, ## .
im family member wey dey live for the south part of Judea. Now e don go back to Nazareth. ## .
People go soon know sey e get belle. This matter really dey worry Mary for mind.## .
Wetin make the matter even bad well well be sey, Mary don already get person wey e want marry. ## .
Na one carpenter wey im name na Joseph. And for the law wey God give Israel people that time, ## .
if woman don gree to marry one man, e come go sleep with another man, dem go stone the woman till e die. ## .
(Deuteronomy 22:23, 24) Na true sey Mary no sleep with any man, but how e go take explain the matter to Joseph, ## .
and wetin go come happen? All this things fit dey worry am. ## .
We know sey Joseph really dey wait to see Mary again, because Mary don travel for three months now. ## .
When Mary see Joseph, e tell am sey e get belle. E try well well to explain to am sey na God use im holy spirit put the pikin for im belle. ## .
But e really hard Joseph to believe wetin Mary tell am. E hard am to understand. ## .
Joseph know sey Mary na good woman wey get better character. And e really love Mary. ## .
But even after Mary don explain to am, Joseph still dey think sey Mary no fit get belle if e no sleep with man. ## .
Joseph no want make dem kill Mary or disgrace am for the whole town. So e tell imself sey e no go marry Mary again. ## .
