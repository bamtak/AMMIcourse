Joseph see Jehovah angel for dream, the angel tell am something wey e go need to do quick quick. ## .
E tell am sey: “Get up, carry the small pikin and im mama, make una run go Egypt, ## .
make you stay there until I tell you wetin you go do, because Herod go soon dey look for the pikin make e kill am. ## .
” (Matthew 2:13) As Joseph wake up, e wake Mary, come tell am wetin the angel talk. ## .
Joseph and Mary carry their pikin run go Egypt that night, dem no waste time. Na the correct time dem run, ## .
because Herod don know sey the astrologers don pass another road go house. ## .
E tell dem sey make dem come tell am where the pikin dey, but dem no go. E vex no be small. ## .
Because e want kill Jesus, e come talk sey make dem kill all the small boys wey dey two years come down. ## .
Whether dem dey Bethlehem or the area wey near am. E tell dem from two years come down, ## .
because wetin the astrologers talk show sey the pikin suppose dey around that age. ##.
Na really wicked thing Herod do as e kill all this boys! We no know how many boys dem kill. ## .
The kind cry wey the boys mama cry match wetin prophet Jeremiah talk for Bible.—Jeremiah 31:15. ##.
By now, Joseph and im family don run go Egypt, and na there dem come dey stay. ## .
One night, Joseph see Jehovah angel for dream again. E tell Joseph sey: ## .
“Get up, carry the pikin and im mama, make una go the land of Israel,  ## .
because the people wey want kill the pikin don die. ## .
” (Matthew 2:20) Now Joseph don ready to go back to where dem come from. ## .
This one still make another thing wey Bible talk happen, sey God Son go come out from Egypt.—Hosea 11:1. ## .
 E fit be sey wetin dey Joseph mind na to go back to Judea, ## .
where dem dey live before dem go Egypt. This place near Bethlehem. ## .
But e come hear sey na Herod wicked pikin wey im name na Archelaus be king for Judea. ## .
For another dream, God warn Joseph about wetin fit happen if e go back to Judea. ## .
 Na im make Joseph and im family go live for Nazareth, one far area for Galilee. ## .
So dem no stay near the area where the temple dey. ## .
This one still match another thing wey Bible talk, sey “Dem go call am Nazareth person.”—Matthew 2:23. ## .
Jesus Stay for Nazareth as E Dey Grow ## .
Jesus don dey grow. The family dey live for one small city wey dem dey call Nazareth. ## .
Nazareth dey the north side of Judea, for the area wey dem dey call Galilee.  ## .
The place dey ontop hill, and e dey the west side of one big river wey dem dey call Sea of Galilee. ## .
Jesus dey around two years when Joseph and Mary carry am come here from Egypt. ## .
That time na only Jesus be the pikin wey Joseph and Mary get. ## .
Later, dem come born other children—James, Joseph, Simon, Judas and some girls. ## .
So, Jesus get at least six brothers and sisters wey e senior. ## .
Jesus still get other family members. We already know Elizabeth and im pikin,  ## .
John wey dey live for Judea. E fit be sey Salome wey dey stay for Galilee with im husband, ## .
Zebedee na Mary sister. Their two sons na James and John and dem fit be Jesus first cousin. ## .
 We no know whether Jesus and this boys really live together as dem dey grow. ## .
But we know sey after dem don grow, all of dem come dey do things together. ## .
Dem come even be part of Jesus apostles. ##.
Joseph really need to work to fit take care of im family. Na carpenter e be. ##.
Since Joseph take care of Jesus like sey na im born am, people dey always call Jesus, ## .
“the carpenter pikin.” (Matthew 13:55) Joseph teach Jesus carpenter work,  ## .
and Jesus know the work well well. Some people even dey call Jesus, “the carpenter.”—Mark 6:3. ##.
Joseph and Mary dey teach their children to do wetin Jehovah want ## .
Joseph and im family make Jehovah the number one person for their life. ## .
Dem dey follow the Law wey e give dem, like the one wey sey make dem dey teach their children wetin Jehovah want  ## .
“when dem dey for house and when dem dey waka for road, before dem sleep, and when dem wake up. ## .
” (Deuteronomy 6:6-9) One synagogue dey Nazareth. ## .
We dey sure sey Joseph dey always carry im family go worship God for there. ## .
Bible talk sey Jesus dey always go the synagogue, and na so “e dey always do for Sabbath day. ## .
” (Luke 4:16) And the family still like to dey travel go Jehovah temple wey dey Jerusalem. ##.
