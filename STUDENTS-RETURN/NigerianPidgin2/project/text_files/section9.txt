Why e good sey Jesus baptize? Jesus no baptize to show sey e don repent from im sin, ## .
but e baptize to show sey e don give imself to im Father. ## .
(Hebrews 10:5-7) Jesus na carpenter, ## .
but now e want start to do the work wey im Father send am come do—the preaching work. ## .
You think sey John dey expect sey something go happen when Jesus don baptize? ## .
See wetin John talk later, e sey: “The Person wey send me come baptize people with water tell me sey: ## .
‘Anybody wey you see sey the spirit dey come ontop am and stay ontop am, na that one dey baptize with holy spirit. ## .
’” (John 1:33) John dey expect sey holy spirit go come ontop one of the people wey e go baptize. ## .
So e no surprise John to see sey holy spirit come ontop Jesus like dove.—Matthew 3:16. ## .
Holy spirit dey come ontop Jesus when e baptize ## .
But no be only that one happen when Jesus baptize. ## .
Bible talk sey heaven open for am. Wetin this one mean? E fit mean sey when Jesus ## .
baptize, e come start to remember all the things wey e know when e dey heaven. ## .
When Jesus baptize, another thing wey happen be sey one voice talk from heaven sey: ## .
“Na my Son be this, wey I choose. I like am well well.” (Matthew 3:17) Who get that voice? ## .
E no fit be Jesus voice because e dey with John for there. The voice na God own. ## .
E clear sey Jesus na God Son. Im and God no be the same. ## .
When Jesus dey this earth, im na God pikin just as Adam be God pikin. ## .
After Luke don talk about Jesus baptism finish, e talk sey: ## .
“When Jesus start im preaching work, e dey around 30 years. As people think, ## .
im na Joseph pikin, Heli pikin, David pikin, Abraham pikin, ## .
Noah pikin, Adam pikin, God pikin.”—Luke 3:23-38. ## .
Na true sey Jesus na God Son just like Adam, but when e baptize, ## .
e come dey clear to am sey im na God Son and sey e go later be spirit for heaven. ## .
So na Jesus be the correct person wey fit teach people the truth from God, ## .
and show dem how to get life wey no go end. This road wey ## .
Jesus don enter so, go lead am reach where e go use im life pay for human being sin. ## .
After John don baptize Jesus, holy spirit come lead Jesus go inside the wilderness wey dey Judea. ## .
Many things just dey come Jesus mind. When e baptize, ## .
“heaven open.” (Matthew 3:16) E mean sey now, Jesus go fit remember the things wey e don learn ## .
and the things wey e do when e dey heaven. Many things really dey for am to think about. ## .
Jesus stay inside that wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights. And e no chop any food. ## .
Na when e don hungry well well Satan come tempt am. Satan tell am sey: ## .
“If you be God son, tell this stones make dem turn to bread. ## .
” (Matthew 4:3) Jesus no gree do wetin Satan tell am, ## .
because e know sey e no good to dey use im power help imself like that. ## .
Satan no stop for there. E try another style. E carry Jesus go up up, for ontop temple. ## .
E come tell am sey make e jump come down. But Jesus no gree do that kind thing, ## .
to show people the kind power wey e get. ## .
E tell Satan wetin God Word talk, sey na bad thing to test Jehovah like that. ## .
Satan come back again the third time. ## .
This time, e show Jesus “all the kingdom wey dey this world and the fine fine things wey dem get. ## .
” E come tell am sey: “Na you I go give all this things, if you bow down and show sey you serve me. ## .
” Jesus no still gree for Satan. E tell am sey: “Comot for here, Satan! ## .
(Matthew 4:8-10) Jesus know sey na only Jehovah we suppose serve. ## .
Na im make e no gree do wetin Satan tell am. E clear sey Jesus no ever comot for Jehovah side. ## .
We fit learn many things from all this temptation and the way Jesus answer Satan. ## .
All this temptation dey real, this one show sey Satan the Devil no be the bad thing wey dey people mind, ## .
as some people dey talk. Satan dey real, but na spirit. ## .
This story don show us sey all the government wey dey this world na im own, ## .
and na im dey control am. Na im make e fit use am tempt Jesus. ## .
