When dem see Jesus, Peter tell am sey: “Everybody dey find you. ## .
”(Mark 1:37) E clear sey people for Capernaum want make Jesus stay. ## .
Dem happy well well for wetin Jesus do for dem, and dem no want “make Jesus leave dem. ## .
”(Luke 4:42) But na only to do miracle and heal people make Jesus come this earth? ## .
And na for only this place e go do im work? Wetin Jesus talk for the matter? ## .
Jesus dey point to one town wey near as e dey talk to Peter, Andrew, James, and John ## .
Jesus answer im disciples sey: “Make we go another place, inside other town wey near so that I go still preach for there, ## .
because na im make me come.” Jesus even tell the people wey want make e stay with dem sey: ## .
“I must preach the good news about God Kingdom for other city, because na this one make me come.”—Mark 1:38; Luke 4:43. ## .
Na true, the main reason why Jesus come this earth na to preach about God Kingdom. ## .
Na the Kingdom go make im Father name clean, and na im go comot all the wahala wey human being dey face. ## .
Jesus do those miracle to show sey na God send am. ## .
Na so Moses still do miracle to show people sey na God send am.—Exodus 4:1-9, 30, 31. ## .
So Jesus comot from Capernaum go preach for other place and im four disciple follow am. ## .
The four disciples na Peter with im brother Andrew, and John with im brother James. ## .
One week don pass since Jesus call dem make dem come dey follow am preach. ## .
Jesus and im four disciples really get better result for the preaching work wey dem do for Galilee. ## .
The truth be sey, people just dey hear about Jesus for everywhere. ## .
The news about Jesus reach everywhere for Syria, even go reach the ten city wey dem dey call Decapolis, ## .
and the other side of River Jordan. ## .
(Matthew 4:24, 25) Plenty people from that area and people from Judea come dey follow Jesus and im disciples. ## .
Many of dem bring sick people make e heal dem. ## .
And Jesus no fail dem—e heal all of dem and pursue the demons wey dey people body. ## .
As Jesus and im four disciples come dey preach for “all the synagogue wey dey Galilee, ## .
” people just dey talk about all the better things wey e dey do for everywhere. ## .
(Mark 1:39) The story come reach one town, wey one man wey get leprosy dey stay. ## .
Luke wey be doctor say leprosy full the man body. ## .
(Luke 5:12) This bad disease dey spoil some part of person body, when the disease don tey for body. ## .
So this man condition serious no be small and the law sey e no go fit stay with people. Anywhere e dey, ## .
when e see people wey dey come, e suppose shout sey e no clean. ## .
This one na to protect people so that dem no go come near am and carry this bad sickness. ## .
(Leviticus 13:45, 46) Wetin this leper come do? He waka meet Jesus, ## .
 kneel down for im front, come beg am sey: “Lord, if you just want, you fit make me clean.”—Matthew 8:2. ## .
The man really get faith for Jesus! And this disease go don suffer am well well! ## .
But wetin Jesus do? Wetin you for do if you dey there? Jesus pity the man, come stretch im hand touch the man. ## .
Jesus tell am sey: “I want do am! Make you dey clean. ## .
”(Matthew 8:3) Even though sey e go hard some people to believe, the leprosy wey dey the man body, just vanish. ## .
You no go like am if person like Jesus, wey get soft mind and power, be your king? ## .
The way Jesus treat this leper really make us get mind sey when Jesus start to rule the whole earth,  ## .
e go do wetin Psalm 72:13 talk, e sey: “E go pity for poor people and people wey dey low, and e go save the life of poor people. ### .
”That time, Jesus go do wetin e get for mind, to help everybody wey dey suffer. ## .
Remember sey, even before Jesus heal this leper, the things wey e dey do don dey make people happy.## .
Now people go hear again sey e don do another miracle. ## .
But Jesus no want make people get faith just because of wetin dem hear. ## .
E know wetin God Word talk, sey “e no go make people hear im voice for street. ## .
”This one mean sey e no go do notice-me! (Isaiah 42:1, 2) So, Jesus come tell the leper wey don well sey: ## .
“Make sure sey you no tell anybody, but go, make the priest see you, ## .
and make you give the gift wey Moses command.”—Matthew 8:4. ## .
But as you know, the man happy well well sotey e no fit close mouth. ## .
As e comot, e begin tell everybody wetin happen to am. ## .
The story come make everybody want know Jesus. E get where the matter reach, ## .
Jesus no come fit dey come out for where people dey again. So sometimes, ## .
e come dey stay where people no dey. Even with that one, people still find am make e teach dem and heal dem. ## .
