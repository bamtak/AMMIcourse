As dem see this thing wey Jesus do, dem remember the things wey dem talk about God Son, sey: ## .
“The love wey I get for your house go burn inside me like fire.” The Jew people come ask Jesus sey: ## .
“Which sign you fit show us, to show sey all this things wey you dey do na true?” Jesus tell dem sey: ## .
“Make una destroy this temple reach ground, and I go use three days build am back.”—John 2:17-19; Psalm 69:9. ## .
Jew people think sey na the temple wey dem dey see Jesus dey talk about, na im dem ask am sey: ## .
“Na temple wey dem use 46 years build, you want use three days build? ## .
”(John 2:20) But the temple wey Jesus dey talk about na im body. ## .
Three years later when God bring Jesus come back to life, im disciples remember this thing wey Jesus talk. ## .
Jesus Teach Nicodemus for Night ## .
For 30 C.E., when Jesus come do Passover for Jerusalem, e do many miracle. ## .
Many people come begin get faith for am. One Pharisee wey im name na Nicodemus, ## .
na one of the Jew people leader for their high court wey dem dey call Sanhedrin. ## .
E really like the things wey Jesus dey do, and e want learn more. ## .
E come go meet Jesus for night. Maybe na because e dey fear sey if people see am, e fit spoil im name. ## .
Nicodemus tell Jesus sey: “Rabbi, we know sey you be teacher wey come from God, ## .
because nobody fit do all this things wey you dey do unless God dey with am. ## .
” Jesus come answer am sey before person go fit enter God Kingdom, the person must be “born again.”—John 3:2, 3. ## .
But, how dem go take born person again? Na im Nicodemus come ask Jesus sey: ## .
“E no go fit enter im mama belle the second time, make dem born am again, e go fit?”—John 3:4. ## .
No, no be wetin born again mean be that. Jesus talk wetin e mean, e sey: ## .
“person wey dem no use water and spirit born, no go fit enter God Kingdom. ## .
” (John 3:5) The time wey Jesus baptize, holy spirit come down on top am. ## .
Na that time dem use “water and spirit” born am. ## .
After Jesus baptize, one voice from heaven come talk sey: ## .
“Na my Son be this, wey I choose. I like am well well. ## .
”(Matthew 3:16, 17) Na so God take tell everybody sey Jesus na im Son and sey e go enter the Kingdom for heaven. ## .
After, for Pentecost 33 C.E., other people wey baptize, go get holy spirit. ## .
and na that time dem go be born again, and come be God sons wey e choose with im spirit.—Acts 2:1-4. ## .
E hard Nicodemus to understand wetin Jesus dey teach am about God Kingdom. ## .
So Jesus come tell am some things about the special work wey e come do for this earth as God Son. ## .
Jesus tell am sey: “Just as Moses take raise the snake up for wilderness, ## .
na so dem go take raise the Son of man up, ## .
so that everybody wey get faith for am go get life wey no go end.”—John 3:14, 15. ## .
Israel people wey snake don bite dey look the copper snake so that dem no go die ## .
That time wey snake dey bite Israel people, ## .
anybody wey look the copper snake no go die. ## .
(Numbers 21:9) Na so e still be with Jesus, ## .
anybody wey show sey e get faith for am, go get life wey no go end. ## .
Jesus come tell Nicodemus something wey show the kind love wey Jehovah get, ## .
e tell am sey: “God love this world well well sotey, e come send im only special Son, ## .
so that anybody wey continue to get faith for am no go destroy, ## .
but e go get life wey no go end.” (John 3:16) About six months after Jesus start im preaching work for Jerusalem, ## .
e make am clear sey na im go save everybody wey dey live for this earth. ## .
Jesus still tell Nicodemus sey: “God no send im Son make e come judge this world. ## .
”E mean sey God no send Jesus make e come judge people for this earth, ## .
e no send am come destroy people. But, as Jesus talk, God send am “make e come save the world.”—John 3:17. ## .
Since na fear make Nicodemus come meet Jesus for night, ## .
the way Jesus take end the discussion really make sense. E tell am sey:  ## .
“This na wetin God go take judge people: ## .
the light [na Jesus life and the things wey e dey teach people] come this world, ## .
but people like darkness pass light, because wetin dem dey do bad. ## .
And anybody wey dey do bad no dey like light, e no dey come where light dey, ## .
so that people no  go correct am for wetin e dey do. ## .
But anybody wey dey do wetin good dey come where light dey, ## .
make people fit see wetin e dey do, because e dey do am well as God want am.”—John 3:19-21. ## .
Na true sey Nicodemus na Pharisee and na teacher for Israel, but now, e dey im hand, ## .
to think about everything wey e don hear about this special work wey Jesus come do for God. ## .
