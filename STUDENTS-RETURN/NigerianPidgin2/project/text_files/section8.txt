Jews wey don repent come meet John make e baptize dem ## .
The baptism na to show sey dem don repent. (Acts 19:4) But no be everybody John gree baptize. ## .
When some Pharisee and Sadducee people come meet am, John call dem “children of viper. ## .
” E tell dem sey: “Make una do wetin go really show sey una don repent. Make una no begin tell unaself sey, ## .
‘Na Abraham be our papa.’ I want make una know sey God fit bring children for Abraham from this stones. ## .
The ax don already dey the bottom of the trees. Any tree wey no dey produce better fruit, ## .
dem go cut am down and throw am for fire.”—Matthew 3:7-10. ## .
The message wey John dey preach na strong message. Plenty people don dey hear the message. ## .
And many of dem dey baptize. So, Jew people come send priests and Levites make dem ask John sey: “Who you be?” ## .
John tell dem sey: “I no be the Christ.” ## .
Dem still ask am sey, “Who you come be? Na you be Elijah?” ## .
E sey, “I no be Elijah.” ## .
Dem ask am again, “Na you be The Prophet?” ## .
The Prophet wey dem dey talk about na the great Prophet wey Moses don talk sey go come.—Deuteronomy 18:15, 18. ## .
John tell dem sey, “No!” ## .
Dem no still leave John o, dem still ask am again:  ## .
“Who you be? Tell us so that we go fit answer the people wey send us come. ## .
Wetin you talk about yourself?” John come tell dem sey:  ## .
“I be person voice wey dey wilderness, wey dey talk loud make people fit hear sey, ## .
‘Make Jehovah road straight,’ just as prophet Isaiah talk before.”—John 1:19-23. ## .
Now, because dem want know, dem ask am sey  ## .
“Why you come dey baptize people when you no be the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?” ## .
John give dem better answer, e sey:  ## .
“I dey baptize people for water. One person wey una no know dey with una, ## .
na the person wey dey come for my back.”—John 1:25-27. ## .
John make am clear for dem sey e dey prepare road for person wey dey come, ## .
e want make the people get the better mind wey dem suppose get before that person come. ## .
The person wey dey come na the Messiah, wey go be King. Na im John get for mind when e talk sey: ## .
“The person wey dey come for my back get power pass me. ## .
I no reach to comot the sandal wey dey im leg.” (Matthew 3:11) John even talk sey:  ## .
“The person wey dey come for my back don dey before me, because e don dey even before dem born me.”—John 1:15. ## .
Na im make the message wey John dey preach make sense, ## .
as e dey tell the people sey “Make una repent, because the Kingdom wey dey heaven go soon come. ## .
” (Matthew 3:2) This one na to let everybody know sey Jesus Christ wey be the King wey Jehovah don choose, ## .
go soon begin the work wey Jehovah send am make e come do for earth. ## .
The Time Wey Jesus Start Im Preaching ## .
“See, God lamb, wey dey carry this world sin comot!”​—John 1:29 ## .
About six months after John the Baptist start im preaching work, Jesus come meet am for River Jordan. ##.
That time, Jesus dey 30 years. Why Jesus come meet John? ## .
No be sey e come greet am or sey e come see how e take dey do im work, ## .
but Jesus come meet John so that John go baptize am. ##.
When Jesus reach there, John no gree baptize am. This na because John know sey Jesus na God special Son. ## .
Na im make e ask Jesus sey: “Na me suppose come meet you make you baptize me, ## .
why e be sey na you come meet me?” (Matthew 3:14) Remember sey Mary visit Elizabeth when Jesus dey belle. ## .
That time, John still dey Elizabeth belle, and e jump up as e hear Mary voice. ## .
Elizabeth go don tell John the story. ##.
John go don still hear the story about wetin the angels tell the shepherds that night wey Mary born Jesus. ## .
John know sey the baptism wey e dey do, na for people wey don repent from their sin. ## .
But Jesus no get sin at all. Even though sey John try stop am, Jesus no gree, ## .
na im make am tell John sey: “Leave am make e be like this now, ## .
because na this one go make us fit do God work well.”—Matthew 3:15. ## .
