“Oga, you no even get bucket to fetch water, and the well deep. ## .
So where you want get that living water from? ## .
Abi you get power pass our great-great grand papa Jacob, wey make this well for us, ## .
and wey im, im children and animals drink from?”—John 4:9-12. ## .
“Jesus come tell am sey: “Anybody wey drink this water go hungry for water again, ## .
but anybody wey drink the water wey I give am, e no go ever hungry for water at all, ## .
but the water wey I go give am go dey flow go up to give am life wey no dey end. ## .
”(John 4:13, 14) Even as Jesus tire reach, e still preach to the woman, so that e go save. ## .
The woman come talk sey: “Oga, give me this water so that ## .
I no go hungry for water again or continue to come fetch water for here. ## .
” Now, e come be like sey Jesus change the topic. ## .
E tell the woman: “Go, call your husband, make una come. ## .
” E come tell Jesus sey: “I no get husband. ## .
” E go really surprise the woman well well to see sey Jesus know many things about am, as Jesus tell am sey: ## .
“You correct when you sey, ‘I no get husband.’ Because you don get five husband before, ## .
and the man wey you dey with now no be your husband. Na the truth you really talk.”—John 4:15-18. ## .
The meaning of wetin Jesus tell the woman dey clear to am, e surprise and sey: ## .
“Oga, now I know sey you be prophet.” Wetin e come do show sey e dey hungry am to know more about God. ## .
How? E come talk sey: “Our papa-papa [Samaria people] dem worship God for this mountain [Mt. Gerizim, wey near there], ## .
but una [Jew people] talk sey na Jerusalem people must go worship God.”—John 4:19, 20. ## .
Jesus still explain to am sey no be the place wey person for worship God matter. E sey: ## .
“The time dey come when una no go worship the Father again for this mountain or for Jerusalem. ## .
”E come tell the woman sey: “The time dey come and e don even reach, ## .
when all the people wey dey really worship God go worship am with spirit ## .
and truth because na this kind of people God want make dem worship am.”—John 4:21, 23, 24. ## .
Wetin the Father dey check for people wey dey worship am well, no be where dem dey stay worship am, ## .
but how dem dey worship am. This one sweet the woman, e come sey: ## .
“I know sey Messiah wey be the Christ go come, and when e come e go explain everything to us.”—John 4:25. ## .
Then, Jesus come tell am one important truth. E sey: “Na me, wey dey talk to you be the person. ## .
” (John 4:26) Think about am! This na woman wey come fetch water for afternoon. ## .
But Jesus still show am special favor. E just tell the woman wetin e never tell anybody before, sey na im be the Messiah. ## .
MANY PEOPLE FROM SAMARIA BELIEVE ## .
Jesus disciples bring food as dem come back from Sychar. ## .
Dem see Jesus for Jacob well, where dem leave am, ## .
but this time e dey talk with one woman from Samaria. As Jesus disciples reach there, ## .
the woman leave the water wey e come fetch and go back to the city. ##. 
When e reach Sychar, the woman tell the people all the things wey Jesus tell am. ## .
Because the woman really believe, e come tell dem sey: ## .
“Make una come see the man wey tell me all the things wey I don do. ## .
” To make the people want know more, e come ask dem sey: ## .
“Una sure sey no be the Christ be this?” (John 4:29) This question dey important well well, ## .
even since the time of Moses, people don dey put mind for this question. ## .
(Deuteronomy 18:18) This one make many people from the city go see Jesus by theirself. ## .
for Sychar, the Samaritan woman tell the people for the city the things wey Jesus tell am ## .
For there, im disciples come tell am sey make e chop the food wey dem buy come. But e tell dem sey: ## .
“I get food wey I go chop, but una no know about am.” Wetin e talk surprise dem, ## .
so dem come start to dey ask each other sey: “Anybody don come give am food? ## .
” Wetin Jesus tell dem na wetin all im disciples fit learn from. E sey: ## .
“My food na to do wetin the Person wey send me want and to finish im work.”—John 4:32-34. ## .
So the work wey Jesus dey talk about no be the wheat harvest, wey go happen around four month time. ## .
But when Jesus tell dem sey: “Make una look the farm, e don reach to harvest. ## .
Already dem don dey pay the people wey dey harvest am, ## .
and dem don dey gather the fruit for life wey no dey end. ## .
So the people wey plant and the people wey harvest, go happy together. ## .
”E dey talk about to dey help people come serve Jehovah.—John 4:35, 36. ## .
