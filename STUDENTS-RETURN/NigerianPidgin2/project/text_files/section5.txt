Some men come from East, dem be astrologers. Astrologer na person wey dey study stars. ## .
Dem believe sey dem fit use am know the meaning of things wey dey happen for person life. ## .
(Isaiah 47:13) When dem dey East, dem see one star, na im dem start to follow am. ## .

When the astrologers reach Jerusalem, dem ask sey: “Wey the pikin wey dem born, ## .
wey go be king of the Jews? We see im star when we dey East, and we don come greet am.”—Matthew 2:1, 2. ## .
When King Herod wey be king for Jerusalem hear am, e no happy at all. ## .
E gather the chief priests and other people wey dey lead for Jew people religion, ## .
come ask dem sey; where dem talk sey dem go born the Christ. Dem answer am as e dey for God Word, ## .
sey na for Bethlehem. (Matthew 2:5; Micah 5:2) Herod tell dem sey make dem carry the astrologers come meet am, ## .
but make dem no let people know. E tell the astrologers sey: “Make una go find the small pikin well, ## .
and when una don see am, make una come tell me so that I go still go greet am.” ## .
(Matthew 2:8) But wetin really dey King Herod mind na to kill the pikin. ## .
