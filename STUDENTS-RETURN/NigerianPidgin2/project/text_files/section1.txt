E dey sweet you to hear good news? The truth be sey good news dey for you, your family and your friends. ## .
This good news dey inside Bible. Na Jehovah, the God wey make everything for heaven and earth use people write the Bible many years ago. ## .
For this book, we go put eye for four Bible book wey get good news for all of us. ## .
The four book dey bear the name of the people wey God use write dem—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. ## .
Many people know this four Bible book as the four Gospels. Wetin all of dem write na the good news about Jesus. ## .
Dem write sey God go use Jesus save us. And since na im be the King of God Kingdom, if we get faith for am, e go bless us forever. ## .
E make sense sey na four different people write about Jesus life. For example, think am sey four people dey listen to one better teacher. ## .
The one wey dey the teacher front na tax collector, the one wey dey im right side na doctor. ## .
The one wey dey the teacher left side na im tight friend, and na fisherman. ##.
And na the one wey stand for the teacher back young pass, e just come watch everything wey dey happen. ## .
All of dem na people wey get better mind and dem no dey reason things the same way.## .
If dem want write about the things wey the teacher do, the four of dem go talk am for different way. ## .
As e be sey the four of dem write the story for their own different style, e mean sey dem go write different different part of wetin the teacher talk and do. ## .
So if we collect all the story wey the four of dem write, we go fit know everything wey the teacher talk and do. ## .
This example show us sey e make sense as four people write Jesus story. ##.
From the example wey we give, when the tax collector dey write, na Jew people e get for mind, so e arrange wetin the teacher teach and the things wey happen, the way e go take help Jew people. ## .
The doctor talk about the sick people wey the teacher heal, so e no talk some of the things wey the tax collector write or e fit be sey e use another style write am. ## .
The one wey be the teacher tight friend talk about the teacher better character and how e dey treat people. ## .
The young man wey just come watch as things dey go no too talk plenty things for im story, e just write everything short short. Even with this one, wetin all of dem write correct. ## .
This one show us how wetin this four apostles write about Jesus life fit help us know the things wey Jesus do, teach, and the kind person wey e be. ## .
Some people dey talk about the ‘Gospel of Matthew’ or the ‘Gospel of John,’ dem still correct, because everything wey dem write na the ‘good news about Jesus Christ. ## .
The truth of the matter be sey everything wey dey inside the four gospels or the good news, na about Jesus. ## .
Many people wey dey study God Word don compare the things wey Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John write, and dem don try see if dem match. ## .
Tatian na Syria man wey dey write book. Around 170 C.E., e try study this four gospels to see if dem match. ## .
After e study dem, e see am sey true true, all of dem match. ## .
Tatian come use the four gospels write one book about Jesus life and preaching, the book name na Diatessaron. ## .
Na the same thing this book wey be, Jesus Na the Road, the Truth, and the Life still do, but only sey na this one correct and complete pass.## .
E happen like that because now we understand the things wey happen for Jesus life and the things wey e teach, pass before. ## .
The things wey we learn don help us understand the things wey e teach and do, even the things wey happen and how dem take happen. ## .
People wey dey find something for inside ground don see many things wey help us know more about the people wey write this gospels. ## .
The truth be sey, nobody go fit talk sey e know exactly how everything take happen. The way this book take talk am make sense. ## .
THE ROAD, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE ## .
As you dey read this book, try get the main message, because na for you and people wey you love. ## .
Remember wetin Jesus Christ tell Thomas, e sey: ‘Na me be the road, the truth, and the life. ## .
Nobody fit come meet my Father unless I show am the road.’ ## .
This book wey be, Jesus Na the Road, the Truth, and the Life go help you see sey true true, Jesus na “the road.” ## .
Na only Jesus we fit follow when we dey pray. Another thing be sey na only Jesus fit bring us back to God. (John 16:23; Romans 5:8) And na only Jesus fit help us be God friend. ## .
Jesus na “the truth.” Everything wey Jesus talk and do na about the truth. When Jesus come this earth, e just be like sey na truth come this earth like human being. ## .
E make many things wey God Word talk happen, so the things wey God Word talk come be “‘Yes’ because of am.” ## .
(2 Corinthians 1:20; John 1:14) As e happen like that, e help us see sey Jesus work really dey important, as the person wey dey make wetin God want happen.—Revelation 19:10. ## .
Jesus Christ na “the life.” As Jesus use im perfect life die for us, na im make we get hope sey we go get the “real life”—“life wey no go end.” ## .
(1 Timothy 6:12, 19; Ephesians 1:7; 1 John 1:7) Jesus still show sey na im be life for people wey go come back to life, because dem go get life wey no go end for paradise.—John 5:28, 29. ##.
Make all of us dey happy for the work wey Jesus dey do to make wetin Jehovah want happen. ## .
Make e dey always sweet you to dey learn from Jesus wey be the road, the truth and the life. ## .
Two Message From God ## .
We fit talk sey everything wey dey inside Bible na message from God. ## .
God give us Bible so that we go fit learn the things wey e want make we learn. ## .
Make we talk about two special message wey God send about 2,000 years ago. ## .
Na angel Gabriel, wey “dey stand for God front,” carry the message come. ## .
(Luke 1:19) How things be when the angel carry this two important message come?
