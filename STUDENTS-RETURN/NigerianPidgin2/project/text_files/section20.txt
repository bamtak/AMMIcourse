Dem no talk plenty things about Jesus preaching for Judea the way dem talk about im preaching for Galilee. ## .
Even though sey many people no gree listen to am for Judea, ## .
that one no stop am to dey preach and do better things for people anywhere e go. ## .
E no tey, Jesus go Jerusalem wey be the main city for Judea, because of the Passover of 31 C.E. ## .
For one busy area wey near the Sheep Gate, e get one big pool wey dem dey call Bethzatha. ## .
People wey dey sick, wey blind and cripple dey come this pool. ## .
Why? Because dem believe sey e fit heal person if e enter the pool when the water dey shake. ## .
For the Sabbath day, Jesus see one man wey don dey sick for 38 years. ## .
E come ask the man sey: “You want make you well?” The man come answer am sey: ## .
“Oga, I no get person wey go put me inside the water when e dey shake. ## .
Before I reach there, another person don first me enter.”—John 5:6, 7. ## .
Jesus come talk something wey surprise the man and other people wey hear am. ## .
E sey: “Stand up, carry your mat, and waka.” (John 5:8) And na wetin the man do be that. ## .
At once, the man carry im mat, and start to dey waka! ## .
Jew people dey talk to one man wey Jesus heal ## .
For Jew people to dey happy for this better thing wey happen, dem come start to dey trouble the man. ## .
Dem tell am sey: “Today na Sabbath, and the law no support make you carry this mat. ## .
”The man come answer dem sey: “The person wey heal me tell me sey, ‘carry your mat, and waka. ## .
’” (John 5:10, 11) The Jews no like am as person dey heal people on Sabbath day. ## .
Dem ask the man sey: “Who be the person wey tell you sey ‘carry am and waka’? ## .
”Why dem dey ask am? Because Jesus ‘don enter where plenty people dey.’ And the man no know Jesus name. ## .
(John 5:12, 13) But this man go still meet Jesus another time. ## .
Later, the man meet Jesus for the temple. Na there e know the name of the person wey heal am. ## .
Later when the man see the Jew people, e tell dem sey na Jesus heal am. ## .
As dem hear am, dem go meet Jesus. No be to go know how Jesus take get power wey e take dey do miracle, ## .
but na to quarrel with am sey e heal person on Sabbath day. Dem come even start to give am problem! ## .
When some Jews talk sey Jesus dey break the Sabbath law because e cure one man, Jesus answer dem sey: ## .
“My Father continue to dey work come reach now, and I no stop to dey work.”—John 5:17. ## .
God law about the Sabbath no forbid the work wey Jesus dey do. ## .
Na God, Jesus dey copy as e dey preach and dey do miracle. ## .
Na im make Jesus continue to do good things everyday. ## .
But the answer wey Jesus give the Jew dem make dem vex more sotey dem want kill am. Why dem vex like that? ## .
Apart from sey, dem dey think sey Jesus dey break the Sabbath law as e dey cure people, ## .
e vex dem well well as Jesus talk sey im na God Son. Dem take am as insult to God for Jesus to call God im Father, ## .
as if Jesus dey talk sey im and God na mate. ## .
But Jesus no fear dem and e even talk about the kind special friend wey im and im Father be. ## .
Jesus talk sey: “The Father love the Son, e show am all the things wey e do.”—John 5:20. ## .
Na the Father dey give life and for olden days, e give some people power to bring people wey die come life again. ## .
Jesus still talk say: “Just as the Father dey bring people wey die come back to life, ## .
na so the Son dey bring anybody wey e want come back to life. ## .
”(John 5:21) Na better thing Jesus talk so and e make us get hope for front. Even now, ## .
Jesus don dey help people know God. Na im make Jesus sey: ## .
“Anybody wey hear my word, and believe am, the Person wey send me come go give am life wey no go end, ## .
and e no go enter judgement, but e go escape death and get life.”—John 5:24. ## .
Even though sey nothing show sey Jesus don bring anybody wey die come life, e let dem know sey e go happen. ## .
E talk sey: the time dey come when all the people wey dey inside grave of remembrance go hear im voice.”—John 5:28, 29. ## .
As Jesus work dey important reach, e make am clear sey e no get power reach God. E talk sey: ## .
“I no fit do one single thing just by myself .because no be wetin I want I dey look for, ## . 
but na wetin the person wey send me want.” (John 5:30) Jesus come explain the important work wey God put for im hand, ## .
something wey e never talk before for public. ## .
