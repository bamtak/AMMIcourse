“People wey well no need doctor, na people wey dey sick need am. ## .
Make una go learn wetin this one mean: ‘I want mercy, no be sacrifice. ## .
’Because na sinners I come call, no be righteous people. ## .
”(Matthew 9:12, 13; Hosea 6:6) No be better mind the Pharisees take call Jesus “teacher,” but dem fit learn wetin good from am. ##.
E fit be sey Matthew want make the tax collectors and sinners hear wetin Jesus dey teach ## .
and make dem fit near God, na im make e invite dem come im house “because many of dem dey follow am. ## .
”(Mark 2:15) Jesus want help dem make dem be God friend. ## .
Jesus no dey look dem with bad eye like the Pharisees wey dey do holy-holy. ## .
E dey pity people; and e fit help people wey no near God, come be God friend. ## .
Jesus dey pity tax collector and sinners. That one no mean sey e like as dem dey sin, ## .
but e dey sorry for dem the way e dey sorry for person wey dey sick. For example, remember when e touch that man wey get leprosy. ## .
Because e pity for am, e sey: “I want do am! Make you dey clean. ## .
”(Matthew 8:3) E good make we get this kind character, ## .
to dey pity people and help dem near God. Na that one better pass! ## .
Why Jesus Disciples No Dey Fast? ## .
E no tey after Jesus go the Passover for 30 C.E. ## .
 before dem come put John for prison. John be want make im disciples dey follow Jesus. ## .
But after dem put John for prison, some of dem come dey follow Jesus. ## .
As the Passover for the year 31 C.E dey near, some of John disciples come meet Jesus and ask am sey: ## .
“Why we and Pharisee people dey fast, but your disciples no dey fast? ## .
”(Matthew 9:14) The Pharisee people dey fast as if to do fasting na something wey person must do. ## .
Later, Jesus use this things wey Pharisee people dey do, teach lesson, e sey if dem dey pray dem go sey: ## .
“God I thank you sey I no be like other people . I dey fast two times a week. ## .
”(Luke 18:11.12) John disciples fit dey fast like the Pharisees. ## .
Or dem fit dey fast because John dey prison. ## .
People wey dey around dey wonder why Jesus disciples no dey fast, ## .
maybe to show sey dem no happy for wetin happen to John. ## .
Jesus use one example answer dem, e sey: ## .
“The friends of the man wey dey marry no get any reason to cry as far as the man wey dey marry dey with dem, ## .
abi dem get any reason? Time dey come when dem go take the man from dem, that time dem go fast.”—Matthew 9:15. ## .
John sey Jesus be like man wey dey marry. (John 3:28, 29) Jesus disciples no need to fast as Jesus still dey with dem. ## .
But later when Jesus go die, im disciples no go happy and food no go hungry dem. ## .
But things go change when God go resurrect Jesus! That time, ## .
dem no go get any reason to fast because person wey dem love die. ## .
Jesus come still talk two other parable, e sey: ## .
“Nobody dey use new cloth patch old outer cloth, ## .
because the new cloth go tear comot from the cloth and the hole go come big pass before. ## .
And people no dey put new wine inside old wineskin. ## .
If dem do am, the wineskin go burst, the wine go waste and the wineskin go spoil. ## .
But na inside new wineskin people dey put new wine.” (Matthew 9:16, 17) Wetin Jesus mean? ## .
Jesus dey teach John disciples something. ## .
E want make dem know sey dem no suppose dey put mind sey im disciples go dey follow the things wey people for Jew religion dey do, ## .
like to dey fast. E no come patch the old way the Jews take dey worship or to make am continue. ## .
E don reach time to trowey this old way of worship. ## .
The kind worship wey Jesus dey encourage dem to follow no be the Jew people own, ## .
wey dey teach human being tradition as belief. ## .
Jesus no dey try to use new cloth patch old one or put new wine inside old wineskin. ## .
Person Fit Do Good Thing On Sabbath Day? ## .
Jesus don preach well well for Galilee. But when e sey, ## .
“I must preach the good news about God Kingdom for other city, ## .
”e mean sey no be only Galilee e get for mind. ## .
“Na im e go, dey preach for all the synagogue wey dey Judea. ## .
”(Luke 4:43, 44) Na better thing because the festival for Jerusalem don dey near. ## .
