E want divorce am make people no know wetin happen. That time, when man and woman don gree sey dem go marry, ## .
people dey take am like sey  dem don already marry. ## .
So if dem choose sey dem no want marry again, dem go need to divorce. ##.
Joseph still dey think about this matter when sleep carry am. As e dey sleep, ## .
Jehovah angel appear to am for dream, come tell am sey: “No fear to take Mary your wife go house, ## .
because na holy spirit make am get the belle. Na boy e go born, make you name am Jesus, ## .
because na im go save im people from all their sin.”—Matthew 1:20, 21. ##.
As Joseph wake up, e really happy sey the matter don clear finish. ## .
Quick quick, e do wetin the angel tell am. E carry Mary go im house. ## .
This one na to show everybody sey two of dem don be husband and wife, ## .
because na so dem dey do marriage that time. But Joseph no sleep with Mary until e born Jesus. ## .
E remain small time make Mary born. But Joseph and Mary need to travel comot from Nazareth. ## .
Now wey Mary want born, where dem come dey go? ## .
Caesar Augustus wey be the emperor for Rome don talk sey everybody must register. ## .
So Joseph and Mary need to travel go Bethlehem wey dey the south part of Jerusalem, because na there dem born Joseph. ## .
Plenty people come register for Bethlehem. The only place wey remain for Joseph ## .
and Mary to stay na where dem dey keep donkey and other animal. ## .
Na there Mary born Jesus. E use cloth wrap Jesus, come put am for inside the container wey dem dey put animal food. ## .
E fit be sey na God put am for Caesar Augustus mind, make e put the law sey everybody must register. ## .
Why we talk like that? Because na this law make Mary born Jesus for Bethlehem wey be the town wey King David come from. ## .
God Word don talk am tey tey sey na for Bethlehem dem go born the King wey God don promise sey go come.—Micah 5:2. ## .
This night wey dem born Jesus na important night! ## .
Some shepherd dey outside dey care for their animal when one bright light shine for their body. ## .
The light na from Jehovah. One angel tell the people sey: “Make una no fear, because I bring good news wey go make everybody happy. ## .
Today for David city, dem don born one person wey go save people. Na im be Christ the Lord. ## .
Na this sign una go take know: Una go see small pikin wey dem wrap with cloth, ## .
and e go dey inside the container wey dem dey put food for animal. ## .
Before dem know, plenty angel appear come begin talk sey: ## .
“Make the God wey dey live for the place wey high pass get the glory, ## .
and for this earth, make people wey dey make God happy get peace.”—Luke 2:10-14. ## .
When the angels don comot, all the shepherd come start to tell each other sey: ## .
“Make we no waste time go Bethlehem, make we go see wetin Jehovah tell us sey happen. ## .
” (Luke 2:15) Dem no waste time go find Jesus, and dem see am exactly where the angel tell dem.## .
 When the shepherd tell the people wey dey there the story, dem come begin wonder. ## .
Mary come dey think about all the things wey dem talk, and e put dem for mind. ## .
Today, many people believe sey na December 25 dem born Jesus. ## .
But for Bethlehem that time, December na rainy season, and cold dey. Sometimes, snow even dey fall. ## .
So that time, for December, shepherds no dey really fit carry their animal go outside for night. ## .
Another thing be sey as Jew people no happy with the emperor, ## .
e fit no come im mind to tell dem sey make dem go register for rainy season, ## .
because that one fit cause wahala. Things wey happen show sey na October dem born Jesus.
Joseph and Mary no go back to Nazareth. Dem stay for Bethlehem. God command Israel people sey, ## .
if dem born boy, dem must circumcise am when e reach eight days. ## .
So when Jesus reach eight days, dem circumcise am. ## .
(Leviticus 12:2, 3) Na that day dem go still name the pikin. ## .
So dem name am Jesus as angel Gabriel don first tell dem. ## .
When Jesus reach 40 days, im papa and mama carry am go the temple wey dey Jerusalem. ##.
The temple no too far from where dem dey stay. The Law talk sey when any woman born boy, ## .
e must come temple after 40 days, and e go make sacrifice to Jehovah so that e go dey clean.—Leviticus 12:4-8. ## .
Na wetin Mary do be that. Na two small bird e bring for the sacrifice. This one show sey Joseph and Mary poor. ## .
