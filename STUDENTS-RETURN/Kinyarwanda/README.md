# Data-Collection-ASR

For this recordings task I recorded 19 sessions. Because of long sentences in some sessions the system was stopping sometimes. The train set is made of 11 sessions and testing set is made of 9 sessions. 

I split the dataset into six folders: Audios for training set are in  "train"  folder, their transcripts are in "Transcript-Train" folder and their meta_data are in "Meta-data-Train". Audios for testing set are in "Test"  folde,  their transcripts are in "Transcript-Test" folder and their meta_data are in "Meta-data-Test"
